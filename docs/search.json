Dr. Greg Newman, co-founder and director of CitSci, and Dr. Stacy Lynn, director of research and education at CitSci, were the primary CitSci stakeholders in the development of this case study. The CitSci stakeholders articulated their goal to be the operationalization of a Participatory Science Campus at CSU and beyond. To assist in the achievement of this goal, the focus of this case study became to research and develop a framework by which interested parties could independently implement successful participatory science projects. Thus, the principal deliverable was the creation of a user-friendly and comprehensive framework that would streamline the project process.\n\n\nView ESRI Story Map\n\n\nView Operationalized Framework"

    "text": "As a wizard and scholar of Middle-earth, I have been studying the magic of the natural world for centuries. Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
