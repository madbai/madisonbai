# Welcome!

I am a Professional Science Master's student in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability at Colorado State University with a concentration in Sustainable Food Systems. I am currently taking courses in R Programming Language, Water Resource Management, Environmental Data Science, Food Systems, and Life Cycle Assessment. I am interested in the Water-Energy-Food Nexus and how this plays out in agrivoltaic systems.\
\
Additionally, I have 6 years experience working abroad in primary, secondary, and tertiary schools. I hold TESOL certification from Arizona State University and American Board Certification of Teacher Excellence in Elementary Education. I am multilingual professional with a minor in German and Japanese Language Proficiency Test N3. I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Business Global Politics from Arizona State University - W. P. Carey School of Business.

On this website, you will find my projects and cv. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my work. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:madison.e.bai@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities.
